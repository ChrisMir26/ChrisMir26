Hey! I'm Chris

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer with a strong affinity for Front End development.

🎒 In the past decade, I have been backpacking around the world, immersing myself in different cultures and exploring new landscapes. During my adventures, I realized my passion for programming and made the decision to transition into a career in web development.

A few years ago, I discovered the exciting world of tech and began acquiring knowledge on my own. To further enhance my skills, I decided to enroll in the Soy Henry Bootcamp, where I honed my expertise in web development. 🚀

👨‍💻 I'm committed to team success and seeking a position where I can apply my skills and continue to grow professionally.

👇Throughout this journey, I have worked with the following technologies:
JavaScript | React.js | Redux | Node.js | PostgreSQL | Express.js | MongoDB | HTML | CSS | SCRUM | Git/GitHub

🎯 My goal is to be part of a company where I can apply my knowledge and continue to grow both professionally and personally. I aim to provide the service they need while unleashing my potential.
